## 🏃‍♂️ Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shijastk/ai-powerd-resume-builder.git
    cd ai-powerd-resume-builder
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **API key (two options):**
    - **In-app (recommended):** start the app and click the **key icon** in the top bar to paste your own Gemini API key. It's stored only in your browser and sent directly to Google. Get a free key at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey.
    - **Build-time fallback (optional):** to ship a default key for everyone, create a `.env.local` file in the root and add:
    ```env
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    A key entered in the UI always takes precedence over the build-time one.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.
